  # ABOUT: The security job triggers a Veracode, CodeQL and BlackDuck scan of your application. This job is set as a required passing status check for pull requests
  # to main. Required status checks are tied to the name of the job thus changing this job's name will require the branch protection rule for status checks to be updated.
  #
  # How to update required status check: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/managing-a-branch-protection-rule

  # ABOUT: The release action publishes your deployable artifact into GH Packages or Nexus also, creates a release tagged
  # with the current version and includes your release notes, and a full changelog.

  # Bamboo can be used to deploy this artifact, if you need that functionality set the variable TRIGGER_BAMBOO to true
  # If a release is not desired for each change to the main branch, comment out this job to skip it during the CI workflow.
